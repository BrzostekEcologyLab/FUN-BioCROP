**Instructions:** 

1) Save the model code (“FUN-BioCROP.Rmd”) and accompanything files (data streams and CORPSE function code) in the same folder. 

2) In “Chunk 3: Load CORPSE Data Streams” set the working directory (setwd) to the folder with the files saved in step #1.

3) If changing any parameter values, edit them in “Chunk 5: Load parameters.” 

4) Run all chunks up to and including “Chunk 10: Prepare Data for Export.”

5) In “Chunk 11: Export results” edit data frames for export and filenames, as necessary. 

6) “Chunk 12: Graph Results” makes a figure of C remaining over the model run period.

**Description:** 

The FUN-BioCROP model (Fixation and Uptake of Nitrogen-Bioenergy Carbon, Rhizosphere, Organisms, and Protection) is a variation of FUN-CORPSE (Fixation and Uptake of Nitrogen-Carbon, Organisms, Rhizosphere, and Protection in the Soil Environment, Sulman et. al. 2017) that has been modified for bioenergy systems by including tillage, harvest, fertilization, organic matter addition, and feedstock-specific parameters. The model is driven by output from DayCent-CABBI (Berardi et al. 2020, Moore et al. 2020), including aboveground NPP, belowground NPP, aboveground C and N, and belowground C and N in juvenile and mature roots. It also uses the same schedule of agricultural events (planting, cultivation, harvest, last growing day, fertilization) as DayCent, except for fire and grazing. 

Tillage is achieved by assigning two new soil compartments to the model: a tilled rhizosphere and tilled bulk soil. In both cases, the percent of tilled soil is assigned with the parameter “pct _tilled” and the amount of protected C that becomes unprotected after tillage is controlled by the parameter “tillPtoUP." 

**Description of each chunk:** 

1. **Chunk 1: Remove all functions, clear memory.** Removes all functions from R environment, clears the memory. 

2. **Chunk 2: Load Packages.** Loads packages necessary to run the code. 

3. **Chunk 3: Load CORPSE Data Streams.** Sets the working directory and loads the data files necessary to run CORPSE.

4. **Chunk 4:** **Load CORPSE Functions.** Loads the R script with CORPSE functions from the working directory, “CORPSE Functions_Bioenergy.R”.

5. **Chunk 5: Load Parameters.** Loads all fixed parameters to run the model. Data frame with definitions of parameters is in the CORPSE function script “CORPSE Functions_Bioenergy.R”

6. **Chunk 6: Prepare Data Streams.** Takes data streams loaded in Chunk 3 and puts them in the format necessary to run the model. The model is coded to run at least two sites at a time, so if only one site is being run it must be run in duplicate. Individual data tables of daily values are created in this chunk from the input data file.

7. **Chunk 7: Set Initial Conditions.** Creates data tables of soil C and N pools for each soil compartment (rhizo_till, rhizo, bulk_till, bulk, litter) and loads initial values into the data tables. Creates lists for each soil compartment to hold model output. 

8. **Chunk 8: Load FUN Data and Set Up Matrices.** Uses DayCent data to calculate FUN input data: root and leaf N demand, total N demand, plant CN, leaf N available for retranslocation, and litter production. Creates matrices for FUN model outputs. 

9. **Chunk 9: Run Model.** Runs the model. 

10. **Chunk 10**: **Prepare Data for Export.** Combines data from each day saved as lists into data frames for each soil compartment. Adds values from all soil compartments together to calculate total soil values, creates separate data frames for each soil C and N pool (e.g., protected slow C) for the total soil value. Adds different C and N pools together to calculate total soil C and N for all layers. Creates data frame of ratio of protected to unprotected SOC. Organizes FUN data for export. 

11. **Chunk 11: Export Results.** Exports CSV files of model results to the working directory. 

12. **Chunk 12: Graph C Remaining.** Makes figure of C remaining over time.
